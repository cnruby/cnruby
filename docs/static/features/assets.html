<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>
<p>Just create a folder named <code>assets</code> under the folder.
the <code>assets</code> folder will not be compiled. static folders do not need to be configured,
its name is always <code>assets</code>. this is a convention.</p>
<p>In the document, you can use them as usual: <code>![name](assets/show.png)</code></p>
